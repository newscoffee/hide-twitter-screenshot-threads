this is a manifest v2 extension for use on image boards; it will attempt to automatically hide threads which use a twitter screenshot as the main image.

it occasionally results in false positives and false negatives, but from my testing it works pretty well; this extension might be worth considering if you are really fed up with twitter screenshot threads.
