# hide twitter screenshot threads

this is a manifest v2 extension for use on image boards; it will attempt to automatically hide threads which use a twitter screenshot as the main image.

it occasionally results in false positives and false negatives, but from my testing it works pretty well; this extension might be worth considering if you are really fed up with twitter screenshot threads.

after a thread is hidden, it will append a 'view' link and if you hover over the link, it will show a preview of the thread with a twitter logo overlay.

you can also pin the extension to the top, and a badge indicator will show how many threads have been hidden on the page.
